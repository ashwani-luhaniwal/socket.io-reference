 * Socket.IO
 * ----------
 * Socket.IO is a JavaScript library for real-time web applications. It enables real-time, bi-directional 
 * communication between web clients and servers. It has two parts: a client-side library that runs in the 
 * browser, and a server-side library for node.js. Both components have an identical API.

 * Real-time applications
 * -----------------------
 * A real-time application (RTA) is an application that functions within a period that the user senses as 
 * immediate or current.
 * Some examples of real-time applications are −
 *      Instant messengers − Chat apps like Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger, etc. You need not refresh your 
 *                           app/website to receive new messages.
 *      Push Notifications − When someone tags you in a picture on Facebook, you receive a notification 
 *                           instantly.
 *      Collaboration Applications − Apps like google docs, which allow multiple people to update same 
 *                           documents simultaneously and apply changes to all people's instances.
 *      Online Gaming − Games like Counter Strike, Call of Duty, etc., are also some examples of real-time 
 *                           applications.

 * Why Socket.IO ?
 * ----------------
 * Writing a real-time application with popular web applications stacks like LAMP (PHP) has traditionally 
 * been very hard. It involves polling the server for changes, keeping track of timestamps, and it is a lot 
 * slower than it should be.
 * 
 * Sockets have traditionally been the solution around which most real-time systems are architected, 
 * providing a bi-directional communication channel between a client and a server. This means that the 
 * server can push messages to clients. Whenever an event occurs, the idea is that the server will get it 
 * and push it to the concerned connected clients.
 * 
 * Socket.IO is quite popular, it is used by Microsoft Office, Yammer, Zendesk, Trello, and numerous other 
 * organizations to build robust real-time systems. It one of the most powerful JavaScript frameworks on 
 * GitHub, and most depended-upon NPM (Node Package Manager) module. Socket.IO also has a huge community, 
 * which means finding help is quite easy.
