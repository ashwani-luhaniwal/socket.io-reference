/**
 * -----------------------
 * Socket.IO - Rooms
 * -----------------------
 * Within each namespace, you can also define arbitrary channels that sockets can join and leave. These 
 * channels are called rooms. Rooms are used to further-separate concerns. Rooms also share the same 
 * socket connection like namespaces. One thing to keep in mind while using rooms is that they can 
 * only be joined on the server side.
 * 
 * --------------
 * Joining Rooms
 * --------------
 * You can call the join method on the socket to subscribe the socket to a given channel/room. For 
 * example, let us create rooms called 'room-<room-number>' and join some clients. As soon as this room 
 * is full, create another room and join clients there.
 * 
 * Note âˆ’ We are currently doing this on the default namespace, i.e. '/'. You can also implement this 
 * in custom namespaces in the same fashion.
 * 
 * To join a room you need to provide the room name as the argument to your join function call.
