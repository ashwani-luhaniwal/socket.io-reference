/**
 * ---------------------------
 * Socket.IO - Event Handling
 * ---------------------------
 * Sockets work based on events. There are some reserved events, which can be accessed using the socket 
 * object on the server side.
 *  These are −
 *      Connect
 *      Message
 *      Disconnect
 *      Reconnect
 *      Ping
 *      Join
 *      Leave
 * 
 * The client-side socket object also provides us with some reserved events, which are −
 *      Connect
 *      Connect_error
 *      Connect_timeout
 *      Reconnect
