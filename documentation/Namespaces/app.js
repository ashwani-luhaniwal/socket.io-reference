/**
 * -----------------------
 * Socket.IO - Namespaces
 * -----------------------
 * Socket.IO allows you to "namespace" your sockets, which essentially means assigning different 
 * endpoints or paths. This is a useful feature to minimize the number of resources (TCP connections) 
 * and at the same time separate concerns within your application by introducing separation between 
 * communication channels. Multiple namespaces actually share the same WebSockets connection thus saving 
 * us socket ports on the server.
 * 
 * Namespaces are created on the server side. However, they are joined by clients by sending a request 
 * to the server.
 * 
 * -------------------
 * Default Namespaces
 * -------------------
 * The root namespace '/' is the default namespace, which is joined by clients if a namespace is not 
 * specified by the client while connecting to the server. All connections to the server using the 
 * socket-object client side are made to the default namespace. For example âˆ’
 * 
 *      var socket = io();
 * 
 * This will connect the client to the default namespace. All events on this namespace connection will 
 * be handled by the io object on the server. All the previous examples were utilizing default namespaces 
 * to communicate with the server and back.
